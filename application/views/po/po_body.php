<td><b>MOTTO OF NSS</b></td>
<td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td>
<td>The motto or watchword of the National Service Scheme is : <b>'NOT ME BUT YOU'</b>. This reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for selfless service and appreciation of the other person's point of view and also to show consideration for fellow human beings. It underlines that the welfare of an individual is ultimately dependent on the welfare of society on the whole. Therefore, it should be the aim of the NSS to demonstrate this motto in its day-to-day programme.</td>

<td><b>NSS SYMBOL</b></td>
<td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td>
<td>The symbol of the National Service Scheme, as appearing on the cover page of this Manual is based on the 'Rath' wheel of the Konark Sun Temple situated in Orissa. These giant wheels of the Sun Temple portray the cycle of creation, preservation and release, and signify the movement in life across time and space. The design of the symbol, a simplified form of the Sun-chariot wheel primarily depicts movement. The wheel signifies the progressive cycle of life. It stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social transformation and upliftment.</td>
